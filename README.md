Hi!

- PhasorArithmetic.py and TruthTableGenerator.py are quick Python scripts that I wrote to solve/check my homework questions for my Intro to Circuits class.

- Aamnrs.java, HummanDecoding.java, MemberCheck.java, and SortByFreqs.java are all quick Java functions from my Data Structures & Algorithms class.
  
- I created oven.circ from a boolean expression/FSM/truth table I derived from a logic prompt for my Computer Architecture class.
  
- tent.c is a project for my Computer Architecture class.
  
- music1.m is a MatLab script I wrote to play Mia & Sebastian's Theme for fun (during Signals & Systems)
